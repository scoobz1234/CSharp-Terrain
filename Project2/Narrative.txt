LOOKJUNGLE:: having a look around the jungle, you see some rather large trees, blue skies, 
and the ground feels soft from years of leaves and compost. To the NORTH you see a 'Tomb' that catches your interest;
LOOKTOMB:: looking up at the large door, you can see a lever to the side that
would most likely grant you access behind you is the jungle where you came from..;
LOOKDEPTHS:: You look into the 'depths' of the cave, and decide there is only one path to take,
so you get ready to travers farther into the cave;
OPENTOMB:: You pull the lever down, and the cave entrance opens, 
revealing a cobblestone path that extends as far as the eye can see...
albeit the eye can't see that far into the darkness...
shall we go inside?;
GOTOCAVE:: As you walk inside the tomb, 
the door slams shut behind you. panic rushes over you,
as you turn around and try to open the door. 
alas you cannot....
You turn around and as your eyes adjust to the dimly lit cave,
you think to yourself.. only one way to go now.. Forward!;
GOTOJUNGLE:: You walk back to the Jungle clearing
 now what? round and round the circle we go?;
GOTODEPTHS:: As you begin your decent into the dark and damp cave,
you hear the quiet pitter patter of feet on the cobblestone floor in front of you..
a shiver runs down your spine... 
a Goblin runs up to you out of the darkness and petitions you for battle 
Shall we 'Battle'?;
GOTOTOMB:: You walk over to the Tomb, 
realizing it is MUCH larger than you originally thought.
What am I to do now? you begin to 'Look' around..;
WIN::
